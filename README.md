# ExperimentGPT

Welcome to ExperimentGPT! This is a AI Chatbot that uses the ChatGPT API. I Currently it is in early alpha, and should be used as so, and not taken seriously. So far it has simple features such as just sending messages and clearing the conversation. The application is built with Node.JS and has a (still being worked on) semi modern frontend without any framework *(pure CSS!)*
